# 2. List the contents of the repository ✅

# Note: Due to Azure DevOps parallelism requirements for new accounts,
# this pipeline shows the configuration and expected output

trigger:
- main
- master

pool:
  name: 'Azure Pipelines'  # Use the hosted pool that has agents available
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

# Pipeline variables for demonstration
variables:
  repositoryName: 'azure-devops-pipeline-assignment'
  assignmentStatus: 'complete'

steps:
# Step 1: Checkout code from GitHub repository
- checkout: self
  displayName: 'Checkout code from GitHub repository'
  clean: true

# Step 2: List repository contents and structure
